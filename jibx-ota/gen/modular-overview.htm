<p>This is the "modular" version of the OTA data model, generated in two stages.
The "base" module (all in the <code>org.ota.shared</code>package, with
<a href="../baseapi/index.html" target="_blank">JavaDocs</a> in the <i>baseapi</i>
directory) includes only the common definitions. Since these are generated
as a separate step, all the common definitions are included in the generated
data model (even if not used by any of the actual messages).</p>

<p>The "extension" module (with these JavaDocs) is generated by using all the
request and response message schemas as input to CodeGen, but building on the
previously-generated "base" module. The classes corresponding to messages and
substructures are grouped into packages representing the type of functionality
provided (as controlled by customizations).</p>
