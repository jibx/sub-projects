<p>This is the "full" version of the OTA data model, generated in a single step
by using all the request and response message schemas as input to CodeGen. The
messages are all generated as separate classes. The classes corresponding to
messages and substructures are grouped into packages representing the type of
functionality provided (as controlled by customizations). Common definitions are
inlined if only used in one place, or if consisting of a single value, and
unused common definitions are ignored.</p>
