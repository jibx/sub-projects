<title>Air Service Implementation</title>

<p>A pair of client and server implementations are supplied to demonstrate the air web
service defined by the <a href="%wsdlgen%">generated WSDL</a>. These both use the same
basic code, though with alternations to match two different web services stacks - Axis2
and JiBX/WS.</p>

<p>The client implementations take one or more request document paths as command line
arguments, reading the documents and submitting them to the server (the request document
type identifies the type of operation being performed). The response document returned
by the server is printed to the console so that you can see the results of each
operation.</p>

<p>The server implementations each read a collection of response documents when the service
is started, organizing the documents by type. Each time an operation of the service is
invoked, the service returns one of these response documents of the appropriate type. Aside
from making sure the document types are correct, the sample code makes no attempt to match
a particular response document with a particular request document.</p>

<p>Both client and server implementations load configuration information from properties
files in the classpath. On the client side this configuration information is in an
<i>air-client.properties</i> file, and specifies the JiBX binding and the web service
endpoint. On the server side the configuration information is in an
<i>air-service.properties</i>, and specifies the JiBX binding and the file path and name
match pattern for the response documents collection.</p>

<p>Each implementation also uses additional configuration information specific to the
web service stack. The <a href="%axis2impl%">Axis2 implementation</a> supports only
standard SOAP web services using HTTP. The <a href="%jibxwsimpl%">JiBX/WS implementation</a>
supports both SOAP and POX (Plain Old XML) web services using HTTP and direct TCP socket
connections, and also supports <a href="http://www.xbis.org">XBIS</a> encoding of XML
document for highest performance (only available when JiBX/WS is used on both client and
server).</p>
