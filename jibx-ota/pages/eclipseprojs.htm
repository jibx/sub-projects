<p>The JiBX/OTA download includes three separate Eclipse projects you can use for working
with the supplied and generated code. Each of these projects requires appropriate User
Libraries to be defined in Eclipse.</p>

<p>To define a User Library, open the <i>Window/Preferences</i> dialog and go to the
<i>Java/Build Path/User Libraries</i> tab, then click "New...". You'll need to type in the
library name (which must match that expected by the project) and click "OK", then click
"Add Jars..." to actually select the .jar files to be included in the library.</p>

<h4>JiBX OTA project</h4>

<p>The JiBX OTA project is in the root directory of the JiBX/OTA distribution. This project
uses a single User Library named "JiBX", which must include the <i>jibx-extras.jar</i>,
<i>jibx-run.jar</i>, <i>joda-time.jar</i>, <i>log4j.jar</i>, <i>xmlpull_1_1_4.jar</i>,
and <i>xpp3.jar</i> .jar files from the JiBX distribution (the last two necessary because
they're used by the document comparison code).</p>

<p>Once you've set up the JiBX User Library, you can import the project into your Eclipse
workspace. To do this, open the <i>File/Import...</i> dialog and select the
<i>General/Existing Projects into Workspace</i> line, then click "Next". In the next
dialog, click on <i>Browse...</i> and navigate to the root directory of your JiBX/OTA
installation, then click <i>OK</i>. You should then see the "JiBX OTA" project in the list
for imports, so just click "Finish" to complete the import.</p>

<h4>Axis2 Implementation project</h4>

<p>The Axis2 Implementation project is in the <i>webservices/axis2</i> directory of the
JiBX/OTA distribution. This project uses both JiBX and Axis2 User Libraries. The Axis2
User Library should include all the jars from your Axis2 distribution, except for the
JiBX jars.</p>

<p>To import the project into your Eclipse workspac, again open the <i>File/Import...</i>
dialog and select the <i>General/Existing Projects into Workspace</i> line, then click
"Next". In the next dialog, click on <i>Browse...</i> and this time navigate to the
<i>webservices/axis2</i> directory of your JiBX/OTA installation, then click <i>OK</i>.
You should then see the "Axis2 Implementation" project in the list for imports, and can
just click "Finish" to complete the import.</p>

<h4>JiBX-WS Implementation project</h4>

<p>The JiBX-WS Implementation project is in the <i>webservices/jibxws</i> directory of the
JiBX/OTA distribution. This project uses both JiBX and JiBXWS User Libraries. The JiBXWS
User Library needs to include only the <i>jibx-ws.jar</i> from your JiBX/WS installation.</p>

<p>To import the project into your Eclipse workspac, again open the <i>File/Import...</i>
dialog and select the <i>General/Existing Projects into Workspace</i> line, then click
"Next". In the next dialog, click on <i>Browse...</i> and this time navigate to the
<i>webservices/jibxws</i> directory of your JiBX/OTA installation, then click <i>OK</i>.
You should then see the "JiBX-WS Implementation" project in the list for imports, and can
just click "Finish" to complete the import.</p>
